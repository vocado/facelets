<blockquote>


     The web community is eagerly seeking a framework like Tapestry, backed by JavaServer Faces
  as the industry standard. While JavaServer Faces and JSP are meant to be aligned,Facelets
  steps outside of the JSP spec and provides a highly performant, JSF-centric view technology.
  Anyone who has created a JSP page will be able to do the same with Facelets. The difference
  is under the hood where all the burden of the JSP Vendor API is removed to more greatly enhance
  JSF performance and provide easy plug-and-go development. Even though Facelets is being
  developed open source under Sun's guidance, it can work with any JSF 1.2 compliant implementation or MyFaces.
